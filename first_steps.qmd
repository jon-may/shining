Open RStudio and if you have not already done so, install the packages *shiny* and (for later *bslib.*

To be tidy, it is best to keep your work in a Project, although you can work with separate files.

Use the ![](images/project-button.png){width="20"} icon in the RStudio menubar to create a new R project in a new directory, and then select a Shiny Application. Give it a sensible name (best to keep it short and meaningful, without spaces). Check the box to open in a new session.

This will create a new folder, containing your project file and a file named **app.R** - this is where you will write your shiny code. You can rename it, but there is no need. If you asked for a new session, app.R will also open in a new RStudio window.

At first, app.R contains some demo code. There are some comments, then code to load the library shiny, a chunk to define an object **ui** (the user interface), a chunk to define a function called **server (**the code that creates the objects in ui), and a line that uses the shinyApp function using the ui object and the server function.

In this screen shot I have edited the code a bit to fold it up so that you can see these three chunks. All your shiny apps will follow this basic format - load libraries, ui, the server and shinyApp().

The default code provided is a runnable shiny app, and you can run it using the ![](images/run-app.png){width="87"} button that has appeared at the top of the editor pane. When you do you should see this:

That's it - you've made a shiny app! Play with the slider to see the graph update.

The next steps will be to make it do what you want to do instead of showing the default content.
