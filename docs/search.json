    "text": "Open RStudio and if you have not already done so, install the packages shiny and (for later bslib.\n\nTo be tidy, it is best to keep your work in a Project, although you can work with separate files.\nUse the  icon in the RStudio menubar to create a new R project in a new directory, and then select a Shiny Application. Give it a sensible name (best to keep it short and meaningful, without spaces). Check the box to open in a new session.\n\nThis will create a new folder, containing your project file and a file named app.R - this is where you will write your shiny code. You can rename it, but there is no need. If you asked for a new session, app.R will also open in a new RStudio window.\nAt first, app.R contains some demo code. There are some comments, then code to load the library shiny, a chunk to define an object ui (the user interface), a chunk to define a function called server (the code that creates the objects in ui), and a line that uses the shinyApp function using the ui object and the server function.\n\nIn this screen shot I have edited the code a bit to fold it up so that you can see these three chunks. All your shiny apps will follow this basic format - load libraries, ui, the server and shinyApp().\nThe default code provided is a runnable shiny app, and you can run it using the  button that has appeared at the top of the editor pane. When you do you should see this:\n\nThat’s it - you’ve made a shiny app! Play with the slider to see the graph update.\nThe next steps will be to make it do what you want to do instead of showing the default content."

    "text": "The ui object in the default app is quite minimal, with a slider and a graph. The code looks more complex because it also includes functions to specify where in the app these two objects appear - the slider is in a sidebar and the graph is in the main panel of the window. There is also a title panel.\nThe slider is created by the sliderInput() and it is embedded within a sidebarPanel() that is part of the sidebarLayout().\nThe parameters passed to the sliderInput() call define the name of the slider (bins), the text to be displayed in the ui (Number of bins:), the minimum and maximum values (1 to 50) and the initial value (30). The name is not shown in the interface but is how the object will be referred to in the server code.\nThe graph is created by the plotOutput(), which is embedded within the mainPanel(). The graph that will be shown is called distPlot, and this will be created in the server code.\nBoth the sidebarLayout and the mainPanel are embedded within a fluidpage() call. A fluidpage is a layout that changes as the window is resized. If you have the app running, try making it narrower - when it gets too narrow, the sidebar will be moved above the main panel. There are many other ways of arranging the ui, and we’ll look at some later, but a fluidpage is a good place to start.\nThe sections below list the input and output types that you’ll need to use. A handy reference cheat sheet is available from Posit."

Here the code creates the distplot output object using the renderPlot() function upon the code contained in the curly braces {…}.\nFirst, x is set to contain column 2 of R’s built-in dataframe faithful (try typing faithful in the console to see it).\nThen bins is created as a sequence ranging from the minimum to the maximum value of x, with the number of bins defined by the value of the bins slider plus 1. Referring to the slider as input$bins lets the code keep it separate from the bins object, which is local to this function.\nFinally, a histogram is drawn using the vector x, with the breakpoints set to the values of bins.\nThe renderPlot() function turns this graphical into the output needed for the plotOutput interface function."

    "text": "Reactivity\nThe whole point of a shiny app is to make the output change when the inputs change, a concept called reactivity.\nThis means that whenever any input object changes, any output object that refers to it is re-evaluated, its code will be run, and the ouptut will change appropriately. In turn, any change to an output object is immediately shown on the ui.\nHere, any change to the slider means that input$bins takes a new value, and as output$distPlot refers to it, this code will be re-run and a new histogram rendered upon the ui.\nThe shiny engine that does this keeps track of what has changed and what has not, so input objects that have not changed are not re-evaluated. This makes it quite efficient and you do not need to worry about saving the results of complicated operations to save repeating them; the engine does this automatically. For example, if you read in a data file using inputFile() and process it, that input and processing only happens once no matter how many times your code accesses the file object or its processed version - until you provide a new data file name."

To display the text on the ui you need to add a textOutput object, so call it descriptives and put it above the density plot:\nmainPanel(\n           textOutput(\"descriptives\"),\n           plotOutput(\"distPlot\")\n        )\nNow define what this text will be by adding its code to server:\noutput$descriptives &lt;- renderText({\n       if(!is.null(input$file)){ \n          file&lt;-input$file\n          data&lt;-read_csv(file$datapath)\n          paste(\"There are\",nrow(data),\n                \"observations with a mean of\",round(mean(data$x),1),\n                \"and a standard deviation of\",round(sd(data$x),2)\n                )\n          }\n      })\nTry running the app again. You should see the descriptives displayed above the density plot.\nOne problem with this code is that lines to read in the code are repeated in both of the server objects. It works but would be effortful to modify to changed the file type, for example. You can economise by putting these two lines into their own object in server:\ndata&lt;-reactive({\n         file&lt;-input$file\n         data&lt;-read_csv(file$datapath)\n   })\nThis object reacts to any change in input$file by reading the contents. The other objects in server can access it as data(), so the full server code can now be:\nserver &lt;- function(input, output) {\n   \n   data&lt;-reactive({\n      if(!is.null(input$file)){\n         file&lt;-input$file\n         data&lt;-read_csv(file$datapath)\n      }\n   })\n   \n    output$distPlot &lt;- renderPlot({\n       if(!is.null(input$file)){\n         data()|&gt;ggplot((aes(x=x)))+\n            geom_density()+\n            theme_minimal()\n       }\n    })\n    \n    output$descriptives &lt;- renderText({\n       if(!is.null(input$file)){ \n          data&lt;-data()\n          paste(\"There are\",nrow(data),\n                \"observations with a mean of\",round(mean(data$x),1),\n                \"and a standard deviation of\",round(sd(data$x),2)\n          )\n       }\n    })\n}"

To do this, log into your account, and go to Applications &gt;&gt; All. Click the gearwheel icon alongside your app, and select the Logs icon from the menubar.
